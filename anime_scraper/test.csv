To combat these vile beasts, ordinary people received superhuman powers and became known as 'Hunters.' Twenty-year-old Sung Jin-Woo is one such Hunter, but he is known as the 'World's Weakest,' owing to his pathetic power compared to even a measly E-Rank. Still, he hunts monsters tirelessly in low-rank Gates to pay for his mother's medical bills. However, this miserable lifestyle changes when Jin-Woo—believing himself to be the only one left to die in a mission gone terribly wrong—awakens in a hospital three days later to find a mysterious screen floating in front of him. This 'Quest Log' demands that Jin-Woo completes an unrealistic and intense training program, or face an appropriate penalty. Initially reluctant to comply because of the quest's rigor, Jin-Woo soon finds that it may just transform him into one of the world's most fearsome Hunters. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",,TV
